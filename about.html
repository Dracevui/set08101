            <h3>How I first met the Potato</h3>
            <p>
              Hi there! It's Liam, and I'm here to tell you about how I first
              fell in love with all things potatoes. It all started when I was a
              freshman at Edinburgh Napier University, and I had just joined the
              Rock Climbing Club. I was on the hunt for a quick and easy source
              of energy to fuel my climbing sessions and stumbled upon the
              humble potato.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, I only knew potatoes as a simple side dish, but as I
              began to experiment with different preparations, I found that they
              were far more versatile and delicious than I had ever imagined. I
              started making potato-based meals before and after climbing
              sessions and quickly realized that I couldn't get enough of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before long, I was cooking up all sorts of potato dishes, from
              baked potatoes and mashed potatoes to potato pancakes and French
              fries. I even started experimenting with different types of
              potatoes and learning about their unique characteristics and
              flavors.
            </p>
            <p>
              As my love for potatoes grew, so did my appreciation for their
              versatility and nutritional value. I discovered that potatoes are
              not only delicious but also a great source of complex
              carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins. I began to see them as the
              perfect fuel for my climbing adventures and a staple of my diet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I still love potatoes as much as ever, and I continue to
              experiment with different preparations and flavor combinations.
              Whether I'm fueling up for a rock climbing session or just looking
              for a tasty and satisfying meal, potatoes are always on the menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              So there you have it, the story of how I first met and fell in
              love with all things potatoes. And who knows, maybe one day I'll
              even combine my two passions and start climbing mountains to find
              the best potato dishes around the world!

            <h3>How Potatoes changed me for the better</h3>
            <p>
              Potatoes have been a major part of my life ever since I was a
              child. Growing up, I remember having potatoes with almost every
              meal, whether it was mashed potatoes with gravy or french fries
              with ketchup. However, it wasn't until I started rock climbing
              that I truly began to appreciate the power of potatoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a rock climber, I need to be in top physical shape to perform
              at my best. I used to rely on processed and sugary foods to give
              me the energy I needed, but that all changed when I started
              incorporating more potatoes into my diet. Potatoes are a fantastic
              source of complex carbohydrates, which provide a slow release of
              energy, keeping me fueled throughout long climbing sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only did potatoes help me with my physical performance, but
              they also helped me mentally. As a university student and an
              active member of the Napier Rock Climbing Club, I often find
              myself juggling multiple tasks and responsibilities. Eating a
              balanced diet that includes plenty of potatoes helps me stay
              focused and sharp, giving me the mental clarity I need to succeed
              in all aspects of my life.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem">
              Overall, potatoes have changed me for the better. They have helped
              me become a better rock climber, a better student, and a better
              person. I now appreciate the value of whole, natural foods and
              their impact on my health and wellbeing. I look forward to
              continuing my love affair with potatoes and all the benefits they
              bring to my life.
