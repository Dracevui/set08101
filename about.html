                <h3>
                    How I first met the Potato
                </h3>
    
                <p>
                    Hi there! It's Liam, and I'm here to tell you about how I first fell in love with all things potatoes. It all started when I was a freshman at Edinburgh Napier University, and I had just joined the Rock Climbing Club. I was on the hunt for a quick and easy source of energy to fuel my climbing sessions and stumbled upon the humble potato.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, I only knew potatoes as a simple side dish, but as I began to experiment with different preparations, I found that they were far more versatile and delicious than I had ever imagined. I started making potato-based meals before and after climbing sessions and quickly realized that I couldn't get enough of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before long, I was cooking up all sorts of potato dishes, from baked potatoes and mashed potatoes to potato pancakes and French fries. I even started experimenting with different types of potatoes and learning about their unique characteristics and flavors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As my love for potatoes grew, so did my appreciation for their versatility and nutritional value. I discovered that potatoes are not only delicious but also a great source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins. I began to see them as the perfect fuel for my climbing adventures and a staple of my diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I still love potatoes as much as ever, and I continue to experiment with different preparations and flavor combinations. Whether I'm fueling up for a rock climbing session or just looking for a tasty and satisfying meal, potatoes are always on the menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there you have it, the story of how I first met and fell in love with all things potatoes. And who knows, maybe one day I'll even combine my two passions and start climbing mountains to find the best potato dishes around the world!
